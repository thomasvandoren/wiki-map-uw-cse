# Browser Support #

## Introduction ##

Gail brought up the notion of browser support in our first exec customer meeting with her. There is a need to specify which browsers are absolutely supported, hope to be supported, and are not supported.

The following lists indicate the oldest version of the given browser that

## Absolutely Support ##

  * Google Chrome 5.x (most users will have the newest version, though)

## Hope to Support (Ranked) ##

  * IE 8
  * Mozilla Firefox 3.5 (TODO: can we promise 3.0?)
  * Internet Explorer 9 (beta)
  * IE 7 (TODO: is this too much?)
  * Apple Safari 4.x
  * Opera 10.50 (If easy)

## Not Supported ##

  * Internet Explorer 6
