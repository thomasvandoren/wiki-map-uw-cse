This directory contains the deployment script. It integrates with 
Hudson to deploy given builds.

This script will gain more functionality over the next cycle. It currently is pretty
flimsy and does not really handle errors.

Usage: deploy -b <build-number> <Project-Name>
       deploy suggest <Project-Name>

  In the first form it deploys the given project to the appropriate location.

  In the second form it suggests the most recent builds for each project
  For example:
    deploy suggest Test-Services # returns the newest build for WikiGraph-Test-Services
    deploy -b 28 Test-Services   # will deploy hudson-WikiGraph-Test-Services-28.tar.gz
