The WikiGraph PHP data api services source.

This module represents all of the scripts which compose our data services.
PHPUnit unit tests are located in the test subdirectory.

NOTE: config.php files are ignored on purpose. They contain mysql connetion
      parameters which should not be committed to a public repository. Don't
      worry the build system has options for creating/copying a config.php
      at build time. See the wiki.
