The PHPUnit unit tests for the services reside in this directory.

To execute all the unit tests:
   phpunit AllTests

NOTE: a config.php needs to exist in this directory in order for the
      unit tests to complete (and pass). The build script has options
      for creating/copying config.php files at build. You are welcome
      to just leave a local copy in here, but do not commit it.
