The WikiGraph frontend client ui source.

The flash client source code is located in the FlexClient/DrawGraph directory. It 
is often developed in FlashDevelop, though this is not a necessity.

It can be built locally using FlashDevelop, the ant build script located at 
FlexClient/DrawGraph/build.xml, or through make at the repo root. See the WikiGraph
wiki for more details about developing, testing, building, and deploying the flash
client.
