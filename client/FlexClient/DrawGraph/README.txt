Just a few quick notes: 
- Calling the graph creation function is done as DrawGraph.DrawG(Array[][],Group)
- Was developed using Flex 4, should work on Flex 3 (I hope)
- if the project doesn't work, should be able to just copy-pasta the code or something. AS files should work on their own.
- main is sort of a sample program, clicking the top-left corner button "lol" should produce results.
- Clicking the nodes on the graph should change them to "lolol" (yeah I was bored).
- DrawG will not yet limit the input length (Arrays can be as long as possible, and it'll create all those buttons, I'll fix this later).
- I'll try to think of more stuff and fix it as time goes on.
