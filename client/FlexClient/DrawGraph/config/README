This directory contains some config files for oompilng the
flash client.

The XML files are compile settings used by MXMLC when it compiles
the source code. TestDrawGraphConfig.xml is used for debugging, running the unit
tests, and the dev branch build/deployment. DrawGraphConfig.xml is used for the
release branch build/deployment. The only difference is that the debug property 
is false on release and true on test.

The action script files are copies of the Config class. The copies in this directory
can be designated at build time (see the CLIENTCONFIG make flag) instead of the 
default Config class. These use relative urls to access the services instead of the 
hard coded http://wikigraph.cs.washington.edu/ domain name. Designating the domain
name is useful for developers so that they can run the application from FlashDevelop
without setting up a local instance of the services.
