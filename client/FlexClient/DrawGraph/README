The frontend flash client is an ActionScript3 project. Opening DrawGraph.as3proj in 
FlashDevelop is a common way to edit the source.

Testing:
If you have ant installed, you can run the following command to execute the unit tests
as they will be on the build server.

	ant test

The unit tests can also be run from FlashDevelop.

  * Open DrawGraph.as3proj in FlashDevelop
  * Right click on tests/DeveloperTest.mxml and select "Always Compile"
  * Build and run the application
  * The results will get printed to the standard console as well as
    be displayed in the Adobe test results console.

*** When you are finished testing in FlashDevelop, please right click on src/Main.mxml and
    select "Always Compile". This makes sure that default target is the actual application.
